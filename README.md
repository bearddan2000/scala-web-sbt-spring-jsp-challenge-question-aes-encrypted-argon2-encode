## Description
A springboot challenge-question web app with jsp support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encrypted with AES and encoded with argon2
to insure strong passwords.

Once the user is created it is given the USER role
by default and auto logged in.

Presents a challenge-question form to challenge-question passwords on any user,
by default the user is reassigned USER role and auto
logged in. Only restriction on passwords are they match;
all validation is done client side.

Uses a challenge question on password rest and user register
to verify user. Customizes user data class by extending the
UserDetailService.
